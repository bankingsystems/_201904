# ABBA replicated by MESA 
An Agent-Based Model of the Banking System (ABBA) using Python ABM library (MESA)

## Description

This python repository replicates ABBA model, which is developed by Jorge A. Chan-Lau (https://github.com/jchanlauimf/ABBA), through MESA library (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa). Current ABBA model is written by NetLogo and it is difficult to combine big data and machine learning libraries. Using Python ABM library, it will extend and generalize this ABBA model.

mesaabba.ipynb notebook file shows a sample simulation of this model.
